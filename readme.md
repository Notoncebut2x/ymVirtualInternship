## Internship overview
The goal of this internship is to provide an opportunity for students from YouthMappers chapters in the United States to work with the USAID GeoCenter supporting Mapping for Resilience programs. The internship aims to build students' technical and leadership skills and increase their understanding of how open geospatial tools and data are used in international development and other industries. Each intern will also work on a final project to support the YouthMappers program.

## Expectations
For the duration of the internship program (February 2 - April 14), you will be required to attend an hour-long virtual meeting with the internship cohort every Tuesday from 2-3 PM EST.

We have created Github pages for each of the weekly meetings. In advance of the meetings, please check the pages for information about homework assignments and icebreaker questions. These pages also include important resources related to the topics covered in the program, such as slide decks and links to tutorials.

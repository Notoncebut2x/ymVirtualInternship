# YouthMappers resources
The [YouthMappers Resource Library](https://sites.google.com/view/youthmapperswiki/home?authuser=0) is your one-stop repository for all things YouthMappers. The homepage contains the YouthMappers events calendar, where you can find out about events hosted by the YouthMappers network, individual chapters, and YouthMappers' partner organizations.

# Academic literature

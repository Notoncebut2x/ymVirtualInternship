  - Create a KoBo survey on a topic of your choice and email it to the group by COB Friday, March 13; complete other internsâ€™ surveys by COB Monday, March 16
    - This is just for fun and so that you can get some practice with the software!
    - The survey should be between 7 - 10 questions with at least 3 different question types (location, audio, picture, text, long, short answer, etc...)  Also include at least 2 conditional questions.
    - Sample surveys from last semester:
      - [Children's books](https://ee.humanitarianresponse.info/x/1nnZVz8q)
      - [Climb a tree](https://ee.humanitarianresponse.info/single/ce2ec8fe1e7b7cccb73c1cdf7bf654da)
  - Meet with two GeoCenter career mentors for 15-minute coffee chats and send Adele, Rory + Natalie short email summarizing what you learned from the conversations (3-4 sentences)
    - We don't have a strict deadline for this assignment since we know some weeks will be busier than others for both you + your mentors - please try to schedule the chats for sometime in the next couple weeks!

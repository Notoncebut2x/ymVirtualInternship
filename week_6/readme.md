    - This is just for fun and so that you can get some practice with the software!
    - The survey should be between 7 - 10 questions with at least 3 different question types (location, audio, picture, text, long, short answer, etc...)  Also include at least 2 conditional questions.
    - Sample surveys from last semester:
